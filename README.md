# AllGoRhythm
***ALL GO with the RHYTHM by Algorithms :)***

This is a lovely repository for algorithms.

Most of the codes are based on existing algorithms in CLRS Book.

I have covered the algorithms that are related to the Algorithms Design course of Persian Gulf University, and I hope there will be more...

In the manner of algorithm, you have two approaches to become human being:

If you stay on `Top` position, you should reach to `Down` to become a human.
Or if you stay in `Bottom` position, you should arrive to `Up` to become a human.
