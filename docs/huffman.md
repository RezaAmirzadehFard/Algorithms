# Huffman

### Prove the correctness of the Huffman greedy algorithm:
 - Pre-proof:
   - Theorem: Prefix-code free equivalent to a binary tree.
     1. prove that can make unique prefix-code from binary tree
     2. prove that can make a unique binary tree from each binary prefix-code
 - Proof
   - Optimal tree is a complete tree.
   - Lemma 1.(greedy choice implies an optimal solution)
   - Lemma 2.(optimal substructure)
   - Theorem
