### Prove the correctness of the Huffman greedy algorithm:
 - Pre-proof:
   - Theorem: Prefix-code free equivalent to a binary tree.
     1. prove that can make unique prefix-code from binary tree
     2. prove that can make a unique binary tree from each binary prefix-code
 - Lemma 1.
 - Lemma 2.
 - Theorem
